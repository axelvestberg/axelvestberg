                <p id="about-text">I began working on this website in December 2018. I had been trying out a lot of
                    different techs in web development but never actually had my own domain to play
                    around with. So here we are. It is still a mystery what will become of this site.
                    Right now the idea is to be a sort of display of smaller programs I've built. But also a
                    sort of portfolio that I can refer too in addition to my extremely messy github.
